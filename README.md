On Ergonomics
ergonomics as a principle is the extent to which something gets out of your way. it "just works", it "just makes sense"
when we think of things that are ergonomic, they tend to be things which either remove discomfort or simply lack any of their own
"A well made suit should fit like a second skin, a well crafted shirt should fit like a first. You shouldnt even know its there" -- Dolce
Well made things serve their purpose without being a burden, they do not get in the way.
They do their job with no discomfort, or remove the discomfort of something else
This means automation is a fundemental principle of ergonomics
synthesis, putting things together in a logical way. things should be easy to reason about and should require reasoning that can be avoided or automated.
what reasoning is required is easy, what isnt required is removed.
